        <h1>Why Drums are better than Bass Guitar</h1>

        <h2>Developing a good sense of rhythm is helpful for learning other instruments</h2>

        <h3> The drums are a perfect secondary or supportive instrument because they ignore melody and harmony and
            hyper-focus on
            rhythm. As you become a better drummer, your sense of timing and feel will also improve when you pick up any
            other
            instrument. </h3>

        <h2>Mastering one beat opens up a ton of other options</h2>

        <h3>Like any other instrument, the drums are hard to master. And it can be tough to get your hands and feet to
            listen to
            you at first. However, once you nail the initial coordination of your first drum beat, learning other beats
            will get
            easier.</h3>

        <h2> Drummers are in demand </h2>

        <h3> It’s hard to find a good drummer. Not only is it less popular than the guitar, but drummers have less room
            for error
            in a band setting. When the bass guitarist makes a mistake, barely anyone will notice. But when the drummer makes
            a
            rhythmic mistake, it’ll be more obvious. Because of this, the standard for drummers is set a little higher.

            Many drummers play in multiple bands because they’re in such high demand (and because it’s fun).</h3>



        <h1>Why you shouldn't choose Bass Guitar over drums</h1>


       <h2> Your fingers will hurt</h2>

       <h3>When you start learning to play the guitar, your fretting fingers will feel like they’re on fire. It takes
        weeks (if not months) to develop strong callouses so the metal strings on the guitar don’t have such a severe
        effect on your fingertips. It’s important to note that if you take breaks from playing your guitar, this pain
        will return, and you’ll have to rebuild that thicker skin all over again.</h3>

        <h2>It can be hard to learn guitar.</h2> 

       <h3> Unlike many other instruments, playing bass guitar requires you to sync up two dissimilar movements to produce a note
        or chord. Striking the string(s) while you place your fretting hand in the correct position requires a lot of
        dexterity. And since you’ll need to perform these actions in tandem every time you want to play something, it
        can take a while before you start producing anything musical, not mentioning the instrument is meant for bass.</h3>

       <h2> Guitar players are a dime a dozen </h2>

       <h3> Since the bass guitar is one of the most popular instruments in the world, there are many great guitar players out there.
        This means there’s a lot more competition when it comes to scoring a spot in a band or project. So if your goal
        is to break out of your basement, it’s important to do what you can to make yourself stand out from the crowd!</h3>
